Play Wordle in your terminal  
![Wordle-CLI](image.png)


### How to run this?
You will need Python installed. Other than that, [just download the game from here](https://github.com/dalvtor/wordle-cli/archive/refs/tags/v0.2.zip), 
uncompress it, go to its folder and open it from your terminal ```python wordle.py```

### Why?
¯\_(ツ)_/¯  
Just to play around with the Python curses module

### Disclaimer
This has only been tested in Linux. It won't probably work in other operating systems yet
