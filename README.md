# Wordle in a terminal
Play Wordle in your terminal  
![Wordle-CLI](image.png)


### How to run this?
You will need Python installed.  
First, [download the game from here](https://github.com/dalvtor/wordle-cli/archive/refs/tags/v0.3.zip) and 
uncompress it.  
Head to the folder where it was uncompressed, open a terminal and type the command```python wordle.py```   
You can also install it with the ```python setup.py develop``` command. If you do so, the game will be available from anywhere by typing ```wordle``` in your terminal.

### Why?
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯  
Just to play around with the Python curses module

### Disclaimer
- This has only been tested in Linux. It won't probably work in other operating systems yet
- The terminal has to be tall enough to show the game. If it crashes, please resize it so it's taller and relaunch the game
